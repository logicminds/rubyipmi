### 0.11.0
This is a big update with many minor changes and bug fixes.  Thank you for all that submitted fixes.
- Removes jeweler dependency and replaces with bundler commands, updates gemspec
- Use HTTPS for homepage field in the gemspec
- Fix infinite loop when executing 'lan print' command
- The retry count counter is currently not incremented, so in the situation
  when this command fails, library enters infinite loop of executing this
  command, which is bad.

  Adds a missing counter incrementation with the same style as
  in basecommands and make it return current @info in case of a failure,
  so all methods accessing it will just get return nil.
